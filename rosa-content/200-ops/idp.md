# Configuring ROSA to use Amazon Cognito for authentication

As part of the [Access Your Cluster](../../100-setup/3-access-cluster/) page, we created a temporary cluster-admin user using the `rosa create admin` command. This uses htpasswd as a local identity provider to allow you to access the cluster. Most ROSA users will want to connect ROSA to a single-sign-on provider, such as Amazon Cognito. In this section of the workshop, we'll configure Amazon Cognito as the cluster identity provider in your ROSA cluster.

The following diagram illustrates the Amazon Cognito user pool [authentication flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html).

## Configure Amazon Cognito

1. First, we need to determine the OAuth callback URL, which we will use to tell Amazon Cognito where it should send authentication responses. To do so, run the following command:

    ```bash
    CLUSTER_DOMAIN=$(rosa describe cluster -c ${WS_USER/_/-} | grep "DNS" | grep -oE '\S+.openshiftapps.com')
    echo "OAuth callback URL: https://oauth-openshift.apps.${CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/oauth2callback/Cognito"
    ```

1. Next, let's create an app client in Amazon Cognito. To do so, run the following command:

    ```bash
    aws cognito-idp create-user-pool-client \
    --user-pool-id ${WS_COGNITO_ID} \
    --client-name ${WS_USER/_/-} \
    --generate-secret \
    --callback-urls "https://oauth-openshift.apps.${CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/oauth2callback/Cognito" \
    --supported-identity-providers COGNITO \
    --allowed-o-auth-scopes "phone" "email" "openid" "profile" \
    --allowed-o-auth-flows code \
    --allowed-o-auth-flows-user-pool-client
    ```

    The output of the command will look something like this:

    ```json
    "UserPoolClient": {
        "UserPoolId": "{{ aws_region }}_i5V2Mxaya",
        "ClientName": "user1-mobbws",
        "ClientId": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
        "ClientSecret": "redacted",
        ...
    ```

    **Ensure that you capture the `ClientId` and `ClientSecret` before moving on to the next steps and store it somewhere safe.**

## Configure ROSA

1. Finally, we need to configure OpenShift to use Amazon Cognito as its identity provider. While Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) offers the ability to configure identity providers via the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM),we're going to configure the clusterâ€™s OAuth provider via the rosa CLI. To do so, run the following command, making sure to replace the variable specified:
    ```bash
    CLIENT_ID=replaceme # Replace this with the ClientId from the step above
    CLIENT_SECRET=replaceme # Replace this with the ClientSecret from the step above
    rosa create idp \
    --cluster ${WS_USER/_/-} \
    --type openid \
    --name Cognito \
    --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \
    --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \
    --issuer-url https://cognito-idp.{{ aws_region }}.amazonaws.com/${WS_COGNITO_ID} \
    --email-claims email \
    --name-claims name \
    --username-claims preferred_username
    ```

1. Next, let's give Cluster Admin permissions to your Amazon Cognito user by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin ${WS_USER}
    ```

    !!! note "You're logged in to the OpenShift CLI already, so you can run this command. You can also grant these permissions via the rosa CLI by using the `rosa grant user cluster-admin` command."

1. Logout from your OpenShift Web Console and browse back to the Console URL (`rosa describe cluster -c ${WS_USER/_/-} -o json | jq -r '.console.url'` if you have forgotten it) and you should see a new option to login called `Cognito`. Select that, and log in using your workshop AWS credentials.

    !!! warning "If you do not see a new **Cognito** login option, wait a few more minutes as this process can take a few minutes to deploy across the cluster and revisit the Console URL."

Congratulations! You've successfully configured your Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) cluster to authenticate with Amazon Cognito.
