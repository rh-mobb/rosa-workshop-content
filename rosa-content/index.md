<!-- ## Overview -->
Welcome to the Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) Hands-on workshop at the Red Hat Plano, TX office! During 
this event, Red Hat Cloud Services experts will guide you through the ROSA architecture and will answer your questions. 

**Who should attend:** This 6 hour long, in-person workshop is ideal for consultants in the field who often work with 
developers, architects, operators, and platform engineers who need a flexible and proven platform to build, deploy 
and scale applications.

**What to expect:** During the workshop, we will take you through a series of content to help you understand some 
of the concepts of deploying container-based applications on ROSA and how to operate an ROSA cluster. We will 
cover the following:

- Complete multiple day 2 operations tasks including: 
    * Configuring node and cluster scaling policies
    * Configuring managed upgrades
    * Configuring single-sign-on for the cluster using AWS Cognito
    * Configuring log forwarding to AWS CloudWatch
- Deploy an application using native OpenShift tooling, and use labels for deterministic app placement on nodes.
- Deploy an application that uses IAM Roles for Service Accounts and AWS STS to connect to an Amazon DynamoDB table
- Make an application scalable and resistant to node failures and upgrades
- Discuss differences between a managed versus self-managed OpenShift offering
