# Instructions For Your Workshop

## The Workshop Environment You Are Using

Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-configured and are ready to use. This includes a Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, an OpenShift Cluster Manager account, and many other supporting resources. The credentials and links for these are included in the table below. Please let us know if you have any issues using these links or credentials! 

While it is not required, you can access your working environment by logging into the AWS Management Console by [clicking here](https://it-cloud-aws-mobb-san-workshop.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region={{ aws_region }}){:target="_blank"}. Do note, the permissions granted to your individual user account are restricted to the AWS `ReadOnlyAccess` and `CloudShellFullAccess` IAM policies. This allows you to view resources in the account but not modify them, while still using AWS CloudShell.

!!! warning "Log out of existing AWS sessions"

    While these commands can be run in any AWS account, we've completed many of the prerequisites for you to ensure they work in the workshop environment. As such, we recommend ensuring that you are logged out of any other AWS sessions.

### Pre-created Resources

- IAM user (with `ReadOnlyAccess` and `CloudShellFullAccess` IAM policies and console access)
- Cloud bastion host (with a special IAM instance profile that allows a permissions scope similar to the AWS `AdministratorAccess` policy)

## Access the Workshop Environment

### Credentials

| Option     | Value                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Username       | **<<<username>>** |
| Red Hat Password       | **<<<rhpassword>>>**      |
| Bastion Password    | **<<<password>>>** |  
| AWS Password    | **<<<password>>>** |

### Important Links

| Title     | Link                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Workshop Content | **[{{ home_url }}]({{ home_url }})** |
| AWS Management Console       | **[https://it-cloud-aws-mobb-san-workshop.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region={{ aws_region }}](https://it-cloud-aws-mobb-san-workshop.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region={{ aws_region }})** |
| OpenShift Cluster Manager       | **[https://console.redhat.com/openshift](https://console.redhat.com/openshift)**    |

### Bastion Access

You have two options for accessing the workshop bastion:

1. Local SSH Client (recommended)
2. AWS CloudShell

It is **highly recommended** that you use a local SSH client (Option 1) unless you are unable to SSH from your local machine. 

#### Option 1: Local SSH Client

Using your local SSH client, connect to the following host:

| Option     | Value                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Host       | **bastion.aws.mobb.cloud** |
| Port       | **22**                 |
| Username    | **<<<username>>>** |  
| Password    | **<<<password>>>** |

For example, if I was using a Linux or Mac terminal, I would run the following command to SSH to the cloud bastion host: 

```
ssh <<<username>>>@bastion.aws.mobb.cloud
```

#### Option 2: AWS CloudShell

AWS CloudShell is recommended for use if your local machine does not have an SSH client or if you are unable to access resources on port 22. AWS CloudShell is a browser-accessible shell provided directly in the AWS Management Console. To use AWS CloudShell, ensure you are logged in to the AWS Management Console and follow the steps below. 

1. To start AWS CloudShell, click on the `>_` button at the top right corner of the AWS Management Console.

1. SSH to the cloud bastion host using the following command (making sure to replace the `#` with your assigned user number):

    ```
    ssh <<<username>>>@bastion.aws.mobb.cloud
    ```

    Enter the password provided by the workshop team when prompted.
